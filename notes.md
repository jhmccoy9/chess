plan:
1. you need to implement the shared code
2. don't worry about anything in ChessGame
3. run the BishopMoveTests.bishopMoveUntilEdge test
   4. work through functions as they throw exceptions until everything passes. Then, try out all the tests

stuff to work on:
chessboard
chesspiece
chessmove
chessposition

I need to override some functions to get this to work
